*This week's meterials were exciting and easy to learn. HTML language intrigues me more and more as we delve deeper in to its functions. One subject I am still having trouble comprehending in its entirety, however, is writing metadata as well as how some of it functions and is detected. It reminds me a tiny bit of how custom commands were written in programming, a topic of which I also struggled to make work properly in execution, so I am relatively intimidated at the prospect of soon having to know more about how to write parameters for it. Other than that one concern, however, this week's work was a fascinating continuation to what was learned during the previous week.*

*It seems that my habit of sailing smoothly through the sea of information came to an end with Topic-05's lesson and it's coresponding assignment, HW-02. On top of mistaking the due date for being at a later time than it really was due at, the deluge of informtation presented proved to be a roadblock for me. I had to take this lesson and assignment at a much slower pace to ensure that I could master its requirements properly. One major problem I encountered in this assignment was making the title element appear in the head section. No matter how I entered it, the title kept showing up as invisible. With no attainable solution in sight, I had to improvise and use a heading in lieu of a title.*
