*This week's meterials were exciting and easy to learn. HTML language intrigues me more and more as we delve deeper in to its functions. One subject I am still having trouble comprehending in its entirety, however, is writing metadata as well as how some of it functions and is detected. It reminds me a tiny bit of how custom commands were written in programming, a topic of which I also struggled to make work properly in execution, so I am relatively intimidated at the prospect of soon having to know more about how to write parameters for it. Other than that one concern, however, this week's work was a fascinating continuation to what was learned during the previous week.*
