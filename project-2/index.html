    <pre> Have your daily cups of tea been lacking
      that proper kick to them lately?
      In this guide, I will show you how
      to steep each leaf to its full
      potential!
    </pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    <pre> First, you will need to gather the
      necessary ingredients.
      This includes:
    </pre>
    <ul>
      <li> A <strong>teapot</strong> <em>or</em> <strong>heatproof mug.</strong></li>
      <li> An <strong>electric kettle.</strong></li>
      <li> <em>Your choice</em> of <strong>looseleaf tea.</strong></li>
      <li> <strong>Tea filters</strong> <em>or</em> a <strong>steeping device</strong> of your choice.
        <ul>
        <li>This can include anything from </br>
          a plain [paper filter](https://www.amazon.com/T-Sac-Filter-Disposable-Infuser-Capacity/dp/B001BLCIN4)
          to everyone's favorite steeper,
          [the Manatea!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YAD1S0E/ref=asc_df_B00YAD1S0E5187200/?tag=hyprod-20&creative=395033&creativeASIN=B00YAD1S0E&linkCode=df0&hvadid=198075789534&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8501217884889480063&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9021299&hvtargid=pla-321213676958)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    <pre> After gathering what you need,
      begin preparing the tea as
      demonstrated:
    </pre>
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li> Fill your electric kettle with water.</li>
      <li> Adjust kettle to heat water to desired temperature.</li>
        <ul>
          <li> Note that differnt teas are best steeped at certain temperatures.</li>
          <li> This includes around 200 degrees Farenheight for black tea,
            175 degrees Farenheight for Green tea,
             and around 160 degrees Farenheight for white tea.</li>
           </ul>
           <li> While your water is heating, measure one teaspoon or more of
             your desired tea into your filter or strainer.</li>
             <li> Place filter or steeper in the vessel you will
               be steeping the tea in as the situation demands.</li>
               <li> When the water is done heating, pour it into your cup or
                 teapot.</li>
                 <li> Let your tea steep. The time needed to bring the tea
                   leaf's flavor out
                   [will vary depending on the type of tea you are brewing](http://www.divinitea.com/images/steeping-chart-full.jpg)</li>
                     <li> Remove the teabag or steeper from cup/teapot
                       and enjoy!</li>
                       </ol>
