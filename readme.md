# *My-Intro-Web-Dev-Homework-Repo*
## Taylor Pirre

If one counts my first time enrolling in this course (which resulted in me withdrawing from it on the first week of class), this will be my third attempt to pass "Intro to Web Design." Hopefully this third time is the charm! I am determined to pass this course with flying colors so that I can be another step closer to obtaining my online Media Arts degree.

The internet:
- Is far more physical in its makeup than what the average user may assume, with packets of information being transmitted over a sprawling web of cables.
- Even though the internet is generally considered a newer form of technology, the breakthroughs that paved the way for the internet began as early as the late 60s. For example, the first message sent between two computers at  long-distance occurred in 1969.
- Information on the internet is sent in the form of "packets," in which an object such as an image or text is broken down into smaller parcels of data so that it can swiftly travel and then be re-assembled into its full form as each packet reaches the client device.
