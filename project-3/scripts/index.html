      They are arranged in the order they were published. Complete and unabridged,
      this edition contains all of the beautiful original illustrations in both color
      and black and white. A rich treat filled with the delicacy and detail of
      Potter's artwork and tales that have never lost their popularity.

      Since the early 1900s, Beatrix Potter's twenty-three little volumes
      featuring rabbits, mice, frogs, and other creatures have delighted children.
      Her first story, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, was an instant success.
      While Potter's clothed animals appear precious, the characters are in fact
       quite mischievous and get into scrapes that children can easily identify
       with. The timeless quality of Potter's stories ensures that her books will
       entertain generations of readers to come.
