-On the internet, data is sent and travels in "packets," small pieces of
information that form a complete unit such as an image or a piece of audio. These packets
are sent from the initial server and travel along cable networks from router to router
until they reach the recipient client device, upon which they are pieced back together
into the full unit that they comprise.

-An IP, or Internet Protocol, address is designated in a way similar to how a location will have a mailing address or
a telephone will have a number. The IP address gives the device the identification it
needs in order to connect to the internet and communicate with other devices. A DNS, the Domain Name System,
assigns a name to the associated IP address. The DNS is a name of a hosted site, and
allows a user to search for and connect to said site without having to know the IP address of
the server that is hosting it.

-A cookie is a piece of data sent from the website a user is accessing to the user's computer so that
the site can record and remember that user's information and interactions with the site.

-The three basic parts of a URL consist of the protocol, the domain name, and
the path.
