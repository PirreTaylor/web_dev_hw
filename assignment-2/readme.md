# Assignment 2

A version control system tracks and records the changes made to a document over time. This system provides the convenience of allowing the author to revert to an earlier version of the document's code if need be, and makes collaborating on projects easier by allowing piers to observe how one or several individuals may have changed the project over time. This course uses a version control system so that the student and, in some cases, instructor, can track the changes made to a project over time and revert to an earlier iteration of the code if needed. It additionally allows for an easy, free, and industry-standard system that can be used for publishing and hosting projects.

As this is my second time taking this course, this section was more of a review. I found the information easy to understand, and also found it interesting that information on how to include relative links and embed images appeared early on this time, and think it's a great idea because it initiates the student with some concepts that will later be utilized on a deeper level with HTML before diving in all the way in.
