## Project 4

1. This page's main topic discusses what Responsive Web Design is and why it is essential.
2. I made the wireframe sketch the main focal point of the site on larger screens with the title and introductory paragraph serving as the focal points on the smaller breakpoints.
3. The primary content is the paragraphs and wireframe sketch, with the header and footer being secondary.

Content includes:
- A background image for the header banner.
- An image of the wireframe sketch.
- The color pallette.
